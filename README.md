Welcome To the CCFC Fan Page, The Cardiff City Football Club and everything it stands for are the focus of this website. You can find upcoming fixtures, top scorers and the history.

## Getting Started

Visit https://rgraingerdev.github.io/CCFCfanpage/ on your preferred web browser to access the CCFC Fan Page. The website is completely responsive; regardless of whether you're using a desktop computer, tablet or smartphone, it should look excellent on all of them.

## User Storys
I have developed user stories to direct my design and development process; in order to make sure that the CCFC Fan Page satisfies the requirements of my users. Here are some usage examples for user stories:


* As a supporter of Cardiff City, I want to be able to swiftly and conveniently find out the latest information on the squad.
* I want to be able to see upcoming fixtures.
* I want to be able to book tickets for upcoming fixtures.
* I want to have access to the most recent standings and top scorers.
* I want to learn more about Cardiff City club history.
* i want to be able to easily navigate the website.
* I want to be able to contact the page creator with my questions.
* I want to be able to know where the stadium is located.
* I want to be able to view the webpage on mobile or tablet.


By developing user stories, I can make sure that the website satisfies user needs and offers a satisfying browsing experience. I regularly gather user feedback and apply it to the design and functionality of the website.

## UI/UX

* The aim is for a first-time user to be able to easily navigate.
* The colour scheme was chosen to reflect the colours of the football team with the intention of making it simple for a novice user to navigate. 
* This page was made so that both new and current club supporters would have a place to check future games and monitor the progress of the current campaign.

### Future features
* Add auto updates for upcoming fixtures.
* A rolling gallery of images of past and present teams.
* Add a live standings table to the season page.

### Font

* Quicksand was the font I chose. The typeface was picked because it is slick and simple for the end user to read, additionally it comes from Google Fonts.
